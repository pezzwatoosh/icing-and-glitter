This summer I had the pleasure of attending Institute of Code‘s 10 day coding retreat in Bali, Indonesia! Not only was it my first time properly exploring that side of the world, it was my first formal exposure to coding after 15+ years! It all began with learning very basic coding in my 7th grade computer class. It was at this pivotal, young age I realized how important it is to be self-reliant. As much as I do need to hire someone to give my bloggy a little make-over, I like to have the option of doing it myself in the meantime while I’m being lazy :)
