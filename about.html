  <p>I founded Icing & Glitter as a creative outlet and portfolio to show to PR companies and magazines I wanted to work.What started out as a hobby quickly turned into a full-time job in and of itself. In July 2016, I took a leap of faith and left my job in publishing to pursue my blog full-time.

  From its inception, my goal was always to spread the belief that no dream is too big. Icing & Glitter is a space that informs, sparks honest conversation, and encourages its readers to live a beautiful, positive life.

  One of the questions I’m asked quite often is why I decided to name my website Icing & Glitter considering my fairly restrained aesthetic. It’s a bit of a funny story actually! Growing up, I’d always wanted to start a dessert catering business, so I thought Icing & Glitter was a fitting name. Of course, that dream never panned out, but the name kinda stuck. I decided to keep it, because I felt it perfectly reflected the positive and inspiring space I wanted to create.
